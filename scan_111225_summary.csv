"Linear Probe Penalties Reduce LLM Sycophancy","http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00967v1","Large language models (LLMs) are often sycophantic, prioritizing agreement with their users over accurate or objective statements. Our experiments show that constructing and optimizing against this surrogate reward function reduces sycophantic behavior in multiple open-source LLMs. Our results suggest a generalizable methodology for reducing unwanted LLM behaviors that are not sufficiently disincentivized by RLHF fine-tuning.","arXiv","2024-12-01","2025-11-12 14:12:04","","True","","discovered","Research paper","30.0"

"ELIS: Efficient LLM Iterative Scheduling System with Response Length Predictor","http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09142v1","Current LLM serving systems often employ a first-come-first-served scheduling strategy, which can lead to the ""head-of-line blocking"" problem. Additionally, we have devised the ISRTF scheduling strategy, an optimization of shortest remaining time first tailored to existing LLM iteration batching. To evaluate our work in an industrial setting, we simulate streams of requests based on our study of real-world user LLM serving trace records.","arXiv","2025-05-14","2025-11-12 14:12:18","","True","","discovered","Research paper","10.0"
"DINGO: Constrained Inference for Diffusion LLMs","http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23061v1","However, existing diffusion models lack the ability to provably enforce user-specified formal constraints, such as regular expressions, which makes them unreliable for tasks that require structured outputs, such as fixed-schema JSON generation. This parallelism makes traditional constrained decoding algorithms, which are designed for sequential token prediction, ineffective at preserving the true output distribution. DINGO enables sampling of output strings with the highest probability under ...","arXiv","2025-05-29","2025-11-12 14:12:18","","True","","discovered","Research paper","10.0"
"Thompson Sampling in Online RLHF with General Function Approximation","http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23927v1","Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has achieved great empirical success in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference, and it is of great importance to study the statistical efficiency of RLHF algorithms from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we consider the online RLHF setting where the preference data is revealed during the learning process and study action value function approximation. Specifically, we adopt Bellman eluder (BE) dimension as the comple...","arXiv","2025-05-29","2025-11-12 14:12:44","","True","","discovered","Research paper","10.0"
"LLM Economist: Large Population Models and Mechanism Design in Multi-Agent Generative Simulacra","http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15815v1","This construction endows economic simulacra with three capabilities requisite for credible fiscal experimentation: (i) optimization of heterogeneous utilities, (ii) principled generation of large, demographically realistic agent populations, and (iii) mechanism design -- the ultimate nudging problem -- expressed entirely in natural language. Experiments with populations of up to one hundred interacting agents show that the planner converges near Stackelberg equilibria that improve aggregate s...","arXiv","2025-07-21","2025-11-12 14:12:19","","True","","discovered","Research paper","10.0"
"ButterflyQuant: Ultra-low-bit LLM Quantization through Learnable Orthogonal Butterfly Transforms","http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09679v2","Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting deployment on consumer hardware. However, these methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case coherence $μ= 1/\\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight distributions. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\\{+1, -1\\}$ entries that are non-differentiable and thus prohibit gradient-based learning, butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization while guaranteeing or...","arXiv","2025-09-11","2025-11-12 14:12:19","","True","","discovered","Research paper","10.0"
"LLM Chemistry Estimation for Multi-LLM Recommendation","http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03930v1","We formalize the notion of chemistry among LLMs, propose algorithms that quantify it by analyzing interaction dependencies, and recommend optimal model ensembles accordingly. Our theoretical analysis shows that chemistry among collaborating LLMs is most evident under heterogeneous model profiles, with its outcome impact shaped by task type, group size, and complexity. Evaluation on classification, summarization, and program repair tasks provides initial evidence for these task-dependent effec...","arXiv","2025-10-04","2025-11-12 14:12:20","","True","","discovered","Research paper","10.0"
"Justitia: Fair and Efficient Scheduling for LLM Applications","http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17015v1","First, given that memory is prevalently a bottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the service cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing algorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay. We have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving diverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling efficiency with fairness...","arXiv","2025-10-19","2025-11-12 14:12:20","","True","","discovered","Research paper","10.0"
