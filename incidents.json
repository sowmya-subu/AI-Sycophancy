Sufficiency conversely captures the classification impact of the non-rationalised context, which interferes with rationale information in the same input. These results exemplify the complexity of rationales, showing that metrics capable of systematically capturing this type of information merit further investigation.",

The policy and value networks then estimate token-level cause--effect relations and use them in the attention layers, yielding causality-guided decision-making. Experiments on object-rich benchmarks demonstrate that STICA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agents in both sample efficiency and final performance.",

ProRAC extracts fundamental RAC elements including actions and questions from the problem, progressively executes each action to derive the final state, and then evaluates the query against the progressed state to arrive at an answer. We evaluate ProRAC on several RAC benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that our approach achieves s...",

This method shows an advantage across different models and various tasks, regardless of whether the answer space is known. Its advantage is maintained even after reinforcement learning, and further analysis shows its reasoning patterns are aligned with human expectations.",

Our framework includes two key components: (1) a game theory-based taxonomy of uncooperative agent behaviors, addressing a notable gap in the existing literature; and (2) a structured, multi-stage simulation pipeline that dynamically generates and refines uncooperative behaviors as agents' states evolve. These findings demonstrate that unc...",

Empirical evaluations show that our method reduces length bias in reward assignment and leads to more concise, content-focused outputs from the policy model. These findings demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively reduces length bias and improves the robustness and content sensitivity of reward modeling in RLHF pipelines.",

Existing LLM-based trading agents, however, largely focus on single-step prediction and lack integrated mechanisms for risk management, which reduces their effectiveness in volatile markets. Experiments on multiple stocks and market conditions show that FinRS achieves superior profitability and stability compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly ov...",

    "summary": "However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved...",

    "summary": "As Decentralized Finance (DeFi) develops, understanding user intent behind DeFi transactions is crucial yet challenging due to complex smart contract interactions, multifaceted on-/off-chain factors, and opaque hex logs. A Meta-Level Planner dynamically coordinates domain experts to decompose multiple perspective-specific intent analyses into solvable subtasks. This work helps provide a more reliable understanding of user motivations in DeFi, offering context-aware explanations for complex bl...",

Our analysis extends to momentum variants such as the stochastic heavy ball (DP-SHB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (DP-NAG), where we show that careful energy constructions yield similar guarantees. These results provide stronger theoretical foundations for differentially private optimization and suggest that, despite privac...",

    "summary": "The Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes plays the role of a source of heavy scalar particles whose $CP$-violating decay into quarks and dark quarks provides particle--anti-particle asymmetries in baryons and dark matter, respectively. Primordial black holes should evaporate after the electroweak phase transition and before the big-bang nucleosynthesis for explaining the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and for consistent cosmology. We find that this scenario explains the observed va...",

Yet state-of-the-art designs lack a principled and efficient way to exchange blocks, which leaves them open to targeted attacks and performance collapse under network asynchrony. We also uncover a new attack, where an adversary steers honest validators into redundant, uncoordinated pulls that exhaust bandwidth and stall progress.",

    "summary": "It has been noted that with the pre-recombination early dark energy (EDE) resolution of Hubble tension, the preference of recent datasets for the evolving dark energy (DE) can be suppressed significantly. In this work, we clarify and reconfirm this result with DESI DR2 and the latest ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1, the tightest small-scale CMB constraints up to date. This reveals the possibility that when the potential resolutions of Hubble tension are considered, current accelerated expansion can att...",

    "summary": "Fast and accurate 3D position detection in optical tweezers (OT) is essential for quantitatively monitoring subtle variations in the mechanical properties of microscopic systems ranging from biomolecules to cells and colloids. This approach generally assumes a linear-response regime in which the signal arises from the interference between the forward scattered and the nonscattered optical fields; however, under certain conditions, the backward-scattered contribution becomes non-negligible, le...",

    "summary": "Yet, the microscopic origin of this mode and its relation to dielectric relaxation still remains debated for pure water with conflicting interpretations attributing it to either translational or rotational molecular motions. In this study, we compute the low-frequency Raman spectrum in the GHz to THz range using ab initio simulations, achieving excellent agreement with experimental data. Detailed decomposition analysis reveals that the rotational and translational contributions are equally im...",

    "summary": "This study presents the first experimental validation of a Hessian-free ray-Born inversion technique for quantitative reconstruction of sound speed from transmission ultrasound data. Unlike previous singly-scattered inversion approaches that account for medium heterogeneities only in the scattering potential, the proposed ray-Born method employs Green's functions approximated along ray trajectories determined by high-frequency assumptions. At each frequency set, the linearized subproblem is s...",

The theoretical treatment includes the rotational degrees of freedom and is benchmarked against a two-dimensional model that can be solved with high accuracy and also compared with photoabsorption experime...",
